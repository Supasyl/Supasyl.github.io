            After a career as a building surveyor I am now a Data Analyst with a certificate from UWA. The top three skills I learned are Python, SQL and R with many others. I love organising and data analytics even takes that a step further by allowing me to also suggest and implement improvements.

            While running my own business, I have proven my skills as a project manager with a critical mind focussed on problem solving to achieve the best outcome for my clients. I am reputable and well respected amongst my peers due to my honesty and integrity. Now that I have gained programming skills in analytics, I am in a unique position to understand what is involved in running a business and can combine my skills to extract the right data and advise you what changes can positively impact your business.
